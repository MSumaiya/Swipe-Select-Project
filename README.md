## Project Name: Swipe-Select Project 

## Project Description

I developed a SPA (Single Page Application) with React Js. The swipe-select component enabled a left-to-right swipable area suitable for selecting one of several option in a fun and interactive way. Itâ€™s built on top of a standard select element, which is enhanced through JS so that the swipe interface is presented instead. The select element remains in the DOM and reflects the current state, meaning that this component can be included in any form. Attributes on the select element, like name, is thus set just as normal.

## Key features:

- A nice, self-contained component that is easy to configure.
- Work well with touch, mouse, and keyboard.
- Completely responsive 
- Used Material UI for better design
- React Swipe component
- Shows a good way to fetch JSON as the source of component values.
- Created separate component for Typography and color variable
